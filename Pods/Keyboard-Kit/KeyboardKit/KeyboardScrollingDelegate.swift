/// A scroll view’s `delegate` can conform to this protocol to receive callbacks about keyboard-driven scrolling animations.
///
/// This can be used with any scrolling component from KeyboardKit: `KeyboardScrollView`, `KeyboardTableView`,
/// `KeyboardTableViewController`, `KeyboardCollectionView`, `KeyboardCollectionViewController` or `KeyboardTextView`.
///
/// If it conforms to `KeyboardScrollingDelegate`, the scroll view’s delegate will receive
/// `willBeginKeyboardScrollingAnimation(toContentOffset:inScrollView:)` and
/// `didEndKeyboardScrollingAnimation(inScrollView:)` when keyboard-driven scrolling animations begin and end.
///
/// When an animation is interrupted by a new keyboard event, the delegate will receive
/// `willBegin` for the new animation before receiving `didEnd` for the animation being cancelled.
///
/// The delegate will not receive `scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation(_:)` callbacks due to keyboard scrolling.
